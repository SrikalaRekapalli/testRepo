## Introduction: Using DgSecure in the Hortonworks Sandbox
DBAs nowadays are no longer involved in the cradle-to-grave life cycle of databases.  They are now separate departments that maintain hundreds of databases and are no longer familiar with every database, every table and every column.  The need to now protect sensitive data within those databases for test/dev users becomes harder and harder without DBAs being tightly involved day after day.  Dataguise’s DgSecure for DBMS will show you how to find all of your sensitive data within these databases and then (with that Discovery knowledge), now confidently mask these copies this protecting your organization from insider breaches.
